- 👋 Hi, I’m @jakezuke, otherwise known as Jake, a designer and business builder
- 👀 I’m interested in _really designing_ (meaning UX and business design, not pure UI design or visual design) products and services that customers old and new will love
- 🌱 I’m currently building an astrology product with [@treshenry](https://github.com/treshenry) called [Cosmic Plumbing[(https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmic-plumbing/)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with folks who truly understand what a good designer can bring
- 📫 You can reach me by [e-mail](mailto:elegant.water3970@ponyloaf.com), [Telegram](https://telegram.me/jake_z), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jakez)
